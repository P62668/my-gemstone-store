# TypeScript Next.js example

This is a really simple project that shows the usage of Next.js with TypeScript.

## Deploy your own

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-typescript&project-name=with-typescript&repository-name=with-typescript)

## How to use it?

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-typescript with-typescript-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example with-typescript with-typescript-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example with-typescript with-typescript-app
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

## Notes

This example shows how to integrate the TypeScript type system into Next.js. Since TypeScript is supported out of the box with Next.js, all we have to do is to install TypeScript.

```shell
npm install --save-dev typescript
```

```shell
yarn install --save-dev typescript
```

```shell
pnpm install --save-dev typescript
```

To enable TypeScript's features, we install the type declarations for React and Node.

```shell
npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom @types/node
```

```shell
yarn install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom @types/node
```

```shell
pnpm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom @types/node
```

When we run `next dev` the next time, Next.js will start looking for any `.ts` or `.tsx` files in our project and builds it. It even automatically creates a `tsconfig.json` file for our project with the recommended settings.

Next.js has built-in TypeScript declarations, so we'll get autocompletion for Next.js' modules straight away.

A `type-check` script is also added to `package.json`, which runs TypeScript's `tsc` CLI in `noEmit` mode to run type-checking separately. You can then include this, for example, in your `test` scripts.

# World-Class Design Patterns for Luxury Gemstone E-Commerce

This project is built to world-class standards for luxury, comfort, and emotional engagement. Every section and component should be measured against these principles:

## 1. Cinematic Visual Storytelling

- Immersive, high-res imagery or video backgrounds that evoke emotion and tell a story (Kolkata heritage, gemstone craftsmanship).
- Layered visuals: gradients, overlays, subtle particles, and bokeh for depth and atmosphere.
- Parallax and scroll-based animations for movement and luxury.

## 2. Luxury Typography & Color

- Elegant, high-contrast fonts (serif for headings, clean sans-serif for body).
- Gold, platinum, deep jewel tones, and rich dark backgrounds.
- Gold foil, shimmer, or animated gradients for headings and accents.

## 3. Glassmorphism & Soft Layering

- Glassy, semi-transparent panels with blur for navbars, cards, overlays.
- Layer content for depth: cards float above backgrounds, with soft drop shadows and subtle borders.

## 4. Micro-Interactions & Delight

- Buttons and CTAs have magnetic, tactile feedback (scale, glow, ripple, or confetti on click).
- Hover states are animated: cards lift, badges shimmer, images shine.
- Scroll indicators, progress bars, and floating badges guide and reward users.

## 5. Editorial, Comfortable Layout

- Generous spacing, clear visual hierarchy, and minimal clutter.
- Cards and carousels are horizontally scrollable, with smooth, cinematic transitions.
- Use whitespace to let content breathe and feel premium.

## 6. Trust & Social Proof

- Prominent, animated trust badges (certifications, heritage, awards).
- Real-time social proof: “X people viewing”, “Recently purchased”, testimonials with photos.
- Subtle, non-intrusive, but always visible.

## 7. Performance & Accessibility

- Animations are smooth, never jarring; fallback for reduced motion.
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible and screen reader friendly.
- Images are optimized and lazy-loaded.

---

**Every new section/component:**

- Ask, “Does this feel cinematic, comfortable, and emotionally engaging? Does it tell a story and build trust?”
- Every visual/interaction should have a reason—either to delight, guide, or reassure the user.
- Consistency: Use the same luxury color palette, typography, and animation style throughout.
- Test on all devices: World-class means flawless on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
